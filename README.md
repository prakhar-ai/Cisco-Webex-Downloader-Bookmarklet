# Cisco Webex Downloader Bookmarklet
The Cisco Webex Downloader Bookmarklet is a simple JS Script that can be used to download Cisco Webex Recordings. It uses clever API calls to the Cisco Webex Server to fetch the video recordings when no download button is available.

## Installation

Visit [this](https://www.prakharj.me/Cisco-Webex-Downloader-Bookmarklet/) page and drag the link to the Bookmarks Toolbar in your browser (press Ctrl-Shift-B to view the bookmarks toolbar in Chrome).

## Usage
- Visit the Cisco Webex recording page 
- Enter the password and play the video
- Click on the Bookmarklet
- Enter the password in the prompt
- The download will start automatically

## Credits
This project heavily borrows from the [WebXDownloader](https://github.com/jacopo-j/WebXDownloader) project by [Japoco Jannone](https://github.com/jacopo-j). It fixes some issues with the WebXDownloader project by adding support for password protected recordings and packaging it into a neat bookmarklet.
